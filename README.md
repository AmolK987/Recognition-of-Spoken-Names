# Recognition-of-Spoken-Names
MATLAB code designed to identify spoken names using speech spectrogram analysis and a list of contact names.

This software works in conjunction with Praat (separate script called through command line) to execute the basic spectrogram creation and formant isolation and overlay 
for further analysis in MATLAB.
